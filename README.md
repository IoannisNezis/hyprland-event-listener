# Hyprland event listener
For my Topbar, that im developing with [eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww), i need to listen to some [hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) events.  
This program is what i came up with to achieve this.  
This might be a stupid aproach, but it works.

Feel free to use it, i dont take responsibility for anything.
